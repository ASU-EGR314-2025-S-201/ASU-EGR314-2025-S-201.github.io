Exhibit Goals:</p> <p>Our exhibit will help visitors compare different elements on the periodic table. This will be accomplished by demonstrating and allowing visitors to attempt the sorting of different elements on the periodic table (represented by small, colored spheres) into associated matching categories. Users will compare different elements and discover the basic differences between atomic categories of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. Visitor input and the resulting accuracy (or error) in their sorting will be displayed on a small display screen.</p> <p>2. Target Audience:</p> <p>The exhibit's intended audience is middle school students. We plan to make the device more accessible by using larger buttons of contrasting colors, and by placing the buttons within easy reach of all users. Middle school students are just beginning to scratch the surface of basic chemistry, and the exhibit will help introduce them to an important related concept. The device can also serve as a reminder of this concept to more experienced users, and serves as an enjoyable color-sorting game for younger students.</p>"},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#generate-ideas-ranking-and-sorting","title":"Generate Ideas, Ranking, and Sorting","text":""},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#step-1-brainstorming","title":"Step 1 - Brainstorming","text":""},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#step-2-narrowing-down","title":"Step 2 - Narrowing Down","text":""},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#step-3-final-choices","title":"Step 3 - Final Choices","text":""},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#concept-sketch","title":"Concept Sketch","text":""},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#exhibit-rationale-and-justification","title":"Exhibit Rationale and Justification","text":"<p>Museum visitors, especially middle school students, need inspiration to increase their enthusiasm for STEM concepts. Museum exhibits are in a unique position to increase young students\u2019 enthusiasm in science concepts with captivating and involved exhibits. Middle school students, though more developed than those between Kindergarten and the fifth grade, have limited attention span, necessitating an exhibit that is both involving and quick to the point. To satisfy this short attention span and to provide an engaging display that teaches basic chemistry concepts, our exhibit will feature bright colors and mobile mechanisms. The device will be themed around the sorting of elements from the periodic table (represented by colored spheres) into three different categories: metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. To provide easily accessible information, a display screen will provide succinct information (less than five words) about the most recent interaction made with the exhibit (for example, a correctly sorted element will trigger a display screen labeling the interaction as correct and providing a short graphic or fact).</p> <p>As per project requirements, each team member must complete one individual subsystem with communication capabilities between other members\u2019 subsystems. Our team has elected to divide the tasks into the following categories:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Internet-based two-way communication.

What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier? One cue we plan to use with our device is color coordination and separation which involve separating three choices based on colors in order to teach elements within the periodic table as either being metallic, nonmetals, and metalloids. Each available color will have a correspondingly colored collection bin, which is a helpful cue in aiding users in correctly sorting the \u201celements\u201d. Another similar cue will be the coloring of the user interface buttons; each button\u2019s coloring will correspond to the color of the collection bin it corresponds to.</p> <p>2. How do you plan on designing your \"controls\"? We plan on implementing a simple control scheme with three differently colored buttons. As a small, colored ball is presented to them, the user is prompted to press one of these buttons, determining to which collection bin the ball will be sent, after which point the accuracy of their choice is confirmed and a new ball is presented. This is the extent of all user interaction.</p> <p>3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience? We plan to make a durable, 3D printed plastic device in order for it to last during the exhibit and place it on a flat, wide surface to prevent any tipping or dropping of particulate \u201celement\u201d objects from the exhibit display table. To enhance safety, possible hazards such as exposed circuitry and mechanical elements will be placed behind a transparent safety barrier, preventing potentially dangerous user contact. For comfort, we intend to use a control system which would be easy to operate with simple input commands to operate our device from a user interface.</p> <p>4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? The device will require minimal visual instruction. User interaction with the device is limited to simple sorting using the three available buttons, and this coupled with the color coordination between the available element types, collection bin colors, and button colors leads to what should be a very obvious interaction mechanic. To supplement these visual cues, small instructional placards will be printed and displayed near each collection bin, instructing the user to press the correspondingly colored buttons as matching colored \u201celements\u201d are presented to them. A text-based instructional placard could provide even further assistance.</p>"},{"location":"03-IdeationAndConceptGeneration/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":""},{"location":"04-Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"04-Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/#team-sequence-diagram","title":"Team Sequence Diagram","text":"Marcus P.MQTT Server2123310Marcus P.MQTT ServerNhat NamActuator #2(Ball Return)A2 to RGB SensorRelease and read next ballA2 to RGB SensorRelease and read next ball27161713Nhat NamActuator #2(Ball Return)JC R.HMIBradley P.Actuator #1 (Path Control)24157Eric M.RGB Sensor192992205Eric M.RGB SensorExhibitUserJC R.HMIDirect Drive ModeAutonomousModeAlternativeExhibitUserSelect Color Choice46HMI to A1Select PathHMI to A1Select PathHMI to A1Select PathPath SelectedTrash MessageHMI to MQTTPath selected is \"Red\"HMI to MQTTPath selected is \"Red\"Display Selected Path AND Accuracy of user input\u00a0Trash MessageRGB Sensor to MQTT\"Color is Red\"A1 to A2Return incoming ballReturn Ball,Trash messageDisplay and store detected color,\u00a0Trash MessageWeb UserWeb UserDisplay General Information for Element GroupRGB to A1Autonomously Select Red PathRGB to A1Autonomously Select Red PathPath SelectedTrash MessageRGB Sensor to MQTT\"Color is Red\"26A1 to A2Return incoming ballReturn Ball,Trash messageDisplay and store detected color,\u00a0Trash MessageA2 to RGB SensorRelease and read next ballLoopA2 to RGB SensorRelease and read next ball2228Release and read new ball,Trash messageDisplay General Information for Element Group(After 60 sec inactivity from HMI)251818Display General Information for Element GroupSelect Color Choice111MQTT to HMIAccuracy of User Input12MQTT to HMIAccuracy of User InputMQTT to HMIAccuracy of User InputRelease and read new ball,Trash message14Display AccuracyBradley P.Actuator #1 (Path Control) <p>Sequence Diagram Download: link</p>"},{"location":"04-Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/#team-message-structure","title":"Team Message Structure","text":"<p>Table 1: Message Types</p> Message Type  byte 1-2  (uint16_t) Description 1 Set actuator x param y 2 Sensor data x 3 Set stepper motor state param x 4 User input button x pushed 5 User accuracy x 6 Subsystem z error code 7 Subsystem z status code <p>Table 2: Message Type definitions</p> <p>Message Type 1: set actuator x param y</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8_t) Byte 4-5 (uint16_t) 0x01 (uint16_t) X (uint8_t) Y (uint16_t) <p>Message Type 2: sensor data RGB</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8_t) Byte 4 (uint8_t) Byte 5 (uint8_t) 0x02 (uint16_t) R (uint8_t) G (uint8_t) B (uint8_t) <p>Message Type 3: set stepper motor state param x</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8_t) 0x03 (uint16_t) X (uint8_t) <p>Message Type 4: User input button x pushed</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8) 0x04 (uint16_t) X (uint8_t) <p>Message Type 5: User accuracy x</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8) 0x05 (uint16_t) X (uint8_t) <p>Message Type 6: subsystem z error code</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8_t) Byte 4 (uint8_t) 0x06 (uint16_t) Z (uint8_t) X (uint8_t) <p>Message Type 7: subsystem z status code</p> Byte 1-2 (uint16_t) Byte 3 (uint8_t) Byte 4 (uint8_t) 0x07 (uint16_t) X (uint8_t) Y (uint8_t) <p>Error Code Key:</p> <ul> <li>0: Subsystem is not receiving data</li> <li>1: Subsystem is unable to perform function</li> </ul> <p>Status Code Key:</p> <ul> <li>0: Subsystem is not active</li> <li>1: Subsystem is active</li> <li>2: Subsystem is performing priority task</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":"<p>This will be the space for all supplementary material.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
