## **Mission Statement**
As this team values the needs of middle school students, we strive to increase their interest in STEM through an interactive display. In addition to inspiring youth, the display will also meet professional engineering standards.

## **Team Goals**
1. Foster open communication within the team to encourage new ideas and provide feedback for one another.
2. Efficintly manage time and resources to maximize the outcomes of the final product.
3. Ensure each team member is in agreement on each deliverable prior to submission. This will provide consistent work throughout the entirety of the project.
4. Develop effective standards for modular subsystems.
5. Successfully implement a performant and intuitive user interface appropriate for middle school students.

## **Team Communication Channels**

| Name   | First Choice Communication   |  Second Choice Communication  | Third Choice Communication |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Eric Mittleman | Text | Discord | Call |
| Marcus Perez | Text | Discord | Call |
| Bradley Pollock | Text | Discord | Call |
| JC Reed | Text | Discord | Call |

_Our team will prioritize communication via text-messaging and discord calls, leaving phone calls as an emergency communication channel. Instructor correspondence will be done as a whole team's responsibility, ensuring the feedback is communicated across the entire group._

## **Meeting Schedule**
The team will meet do work on the project at the following times: 

- Tuesdays/Thursdays from 4:15-6:00PM
- Fridays after 4:00PM.

## **Meeting Coordination**
We will use text messages to remind the group of the meeting the day prior. If meeting times need to be changed or added, we will discuss this with the team either in person or through text messaging. The preferred method for meetings will be face-to-face (virtual meetings will be held on an as-needed basis). Important procedures that are necessary for the team would be to contact one another if someone cannot make it to the meeting and plan ahead if there is interference with these times.

## **Roles and responsibilities**
| Role   | Duties   |
|------------|------------|
| Eric Mittleman | Compatibility Specialist |
| Marcus Perez | Progress Monitor |
| Bradley Pollock | Recorder |
| JC Reed | Team Lead |

## Team Coordination and Accountability
Discuss, decide upon, and answer how you will:

1. Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment?
  * We will communicate with each other to ensure that we have not missed anything in the assignment and will meet in person if need be when we have to work on it as a group effort.
2. Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how you will adjust if not?
  * We will work with what our individual strengths are and if one person is strugglilng with their part of the group, they should notify early on that they cannot do thier part and need help. Then we should lend a hand to help that person get some experience with that problem and help them solve it along the way.
3. Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?
  * We will likely meetup if we receive feedback from the professor and together ask for clarification for what feedback we received in person or anytime that we are all available. If we're not all available we have the responsibility of emailing the professor about the feedback with one member and that member should contact the group with updates based on the feedback.
