## Mission Statement
As this team values the needs of middle school students, we strive to increase their interest in STEM through an interactive display. In addition to inspiring youth, the display will also meet professional engineering standards.

## Team Goals
1. Foster open communication within the team to encourage new ideas and provide feedback for one another.
2. Efficintly manage time and resources to maximize the outcomes of the final product.
3. Ensure each team member is in agreement on each deliverable prior to submission. This will provide consistent work throughout the entirety of the project.
4. Develop effective standards for modular subsystems.
5. Successfully implement a performant and intuitive user interface appropriate for middle school students.

## Team Communication Channels

| Name   | First Choice Communication   |  Second Choice Communication  | Third Choice Communication |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Eric Mittleman | Text | Discord | Call |
| Marcus Perez | Text | Discord | Call |
| Bradley Pollock | Text | Discord | Call |
| JC Reed | Text | Discord | Call |

Our team will prioritize communication via text-messaging and discord calls, leaving phone calls as an emergency communication channel. Instructor correspondence will be done as a whole team's responsibility, ensuring the feedback is communicated across the entire group.

## Meeting Schedule
The team will meet do work on the project at the following times: 
- Tuesdays/Thursdays from 4:15-6:00PM
- Fridays after 4:00PM.

## Meeting Coordination
We will use text messages to remind the group of the meeting the day prior. If meeting times need to be changed or added, we will discuss this with the team either in person or through text messaging. The preferred method for meetings will be face-to-face (virtual meetings will be held on an as-needed basis). Important procedures that are necessary for the team would be to contact one another if someone cannot make it to the meeting and plan ahead if there is interference with these times.
