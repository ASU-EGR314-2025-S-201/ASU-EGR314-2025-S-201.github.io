## **Decision Making & Meeting Requirements**

Team 201 decided on their final design by analyzing several potential key factors. The team discussed important concepts based on the project’s focus *(STEM-focused science exhibits)* to generate **one hundred** potential key factors or design criteria that best reflected those goals. As the team generated these ideas, we filtered out ideas that we deemed unfeasible, extraneous, or non-applicable *(see “Step 2 - Narrowing Down”, below)* and eventually decided on an element-sorting game based on the final seven criteria selected *(see “Step 3 - Final Choices” below)*.    

The team used these final seven criteria to develop a set of Project Goals, found near the top of this page, that served as a framework for the decision-making used over the course of the project. These goals, along with a decision to focus on middle school aged children, informed the team’s development of the final design concept *(“see Concept Sketch”)*. Take for example the “color coded” notecard seen in “Final Choices”; as the team deliberated how to best demonstrate the concept of elements from the periodic table in a museum exhibit, the idea of color sorting appeared increasingly attractive as a design feature, simplifying a concept into a specific task that promotes learning. The design concept reflects this by featuring sorting as a major function, and even influenced the design of the Human-Machine interface. This feature also reflects the “easy to use” criteria. As the design processed into the final stages, these criteria led to the decision of large, brightly-colored buttons. The decision for the style of buttons was made as the team discussed how applicable various button designs were to the seven original concept ideas, and the team decided that this feature would best reflect the chosen design criteria as well as invite younger users with an easy-to-use, approachable design.  

>The brightly-colored buttons indeed invited younger audiences. During the Innovation Showcase event on May 2, during which a number of young children found the buttons highly entertaining, while a parent enjoyed learning about chemistry. This shows the wisdom in narrowing down the design criteria from the original one hundred to a reasonable, performant seven. 

## **Learn about Science Exhibits**



**1. Exhibit Goals:**

Our exhibit will help visitors compare different elements on the periodic table. This will be accomplished by demonstrating and allowing visitors to attempt the sorting of different elements on the periodic table (represented by small, colored spheres) into associated matching categories. Users will compare different elements and discover the basic differences between atomic categories of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. Visitor input and the resulting accuracy (or error) in their sorting will be displayed on a small display screen.

**2. Target Audience:**

The exhibit's intended audience is middle school students. We plan to make the device more accessible by using larger buttons of contrasting colors, and by placing the buttons within easy reach of all users. Middle school students are just beginning to scratch the surface of basic chemistry, and the exhibit will help introduce them to an important related concept. The device can also serve as a reminder of this concept to more experienced users, and serves as an enjoyable color-sorting game for younger students.

## **Generate Ideas, Ranking, and Sorting**

The following images display the process of idea generation and selection, with a photo depicting some of the design ideas that were considered closer to the final concept design. The team started by generating 100 concepts or design features ranging from various STEM topics to focus the exhibit on to key aspects of design, such as incorporating an easy-to-use user interface. After this point, the team began evaluating carefully each proposed idea, and narrowed the selection window down to twenty, and eventually down to a final seven design criteria that would influence the decisions made over the course of the project.

The final seven ideas pictured above were decided on as the team discussed the necessary criteria for interactive museum exhibits and the creative goals held by the team based on our selected audience. Team 201 found the connections between the seven original criteria and the final product presented at the May 2 innovation showcase to be very linear. The device is very user-focused, reflecting such criteria as “Safe, Easy-to-use”, “Big, obvious UI”, and “Interactive”, while the concepts “Marbles”, “Color/type Sorter”, and “Color-coded” were reflected in the overall project design.

## **Concept Sketch**

The picture below showcases the final concept sketch developed in SolidWorks by team member Eric. The device was instrumental in the development of the final product, with many features included in the design showcase (such as the large hopper, dowel rod suspension, and the indexing stepper motor.

## **Exhibit Rationale and Justification**
Museum visitors, especially middle school students, need inspiration to increase their enthusiasm for STEM concepts. Museum exhibits are in a unique position to increase young students’ enthusiasm in science concepts with captivating and involved exhibits. Middle school students, though more developed than those between Kindergarten and the fifth grade, have limited attention span, necessitating an exhibit that is both involving and quick to the point. To satisfy this short attention span and to provide an engaging display that teaches basic chemistry concepts, our exhibit will feature bright colors and mobile mechanisms. The device will be themed around the sorting of elements from the periodic table (represented by colored spheres) into three different categories: metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. To provide easily accessible information, a display screen will provide succinct information (less than five words) about the most recent interaction made with the exhibit (for example, a correctly sorted element will trigger a display screen labeling the interaction as correct and providing a short graphic or fact).

As per project requirements, each team member must complete one individual subsystem with communication capabilities between other members’ subsystems. Our team has elected to divide the tasks into the following categories:

- **Internet-based two-way communication.** The majority of this section will be handled by Marcus.

- **Human machine interface via a screen/buttons.** The majority of this section will be handled by JC.

- **Sensor-based controlled response.** The majority of this section will be handled by Eric.

- **Actuator response.** The majority of this section will be handled by Bradley.

## **Exhibit FAQ's** 
**1. What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?**
One cue we plan to use with our device is color coordination and separation which involve separating three choices based on colors in order to teach elements within the periodic table as either being metallic, nonmetals, and metalloids. Each available color will have a correspondingly colored collection bin, which is a helpful cue in aiding users in correctly sorting the “elements”. Another similar cue will be the coloring of the user interface buttons; each button’s coloring will correspond to the color of the collection bin it corresponds to.

**2. How do you plan on designing your "controls"?**
We plan on implementing a simple control scheme with three differently colored buttons. As a small, colored ball is presented to them, the user is prompted to press one of these buttons, determining to which collection bin the ball will be sent, after which point the accuracy of their choice is confirmed and a new ball is presented. This is the extent of all user interaction.

**3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?**
We plan to make a durable, 3D printed plastic device in order for it to last during the exhibit and place it on a flat, wide surface to prevent any tipping or dropping of particulate “element” objects from the exhibit display table. To enhance safety, possible hazards such as exposed circuitry and mechanical elements will be placed behind a transparent safety barrier, preventing potentially dangerous user contact. For comfort, we intend to use a control system which would be easy to operate with simple input commands to operate our device from a user interface.

**4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device?**
The device will require minimal visual instruction. User interaction with the device is limited to simple sorting using the three available buttons, and this coupled with the color coordination between the available element types, collection bin colors, and button colors leads to what should be a very obvious interaction mechanic. To supplement these visual cues, small instructional placards will be printed and displayed near each collection bin, instructing the user to press the correspondingly colored buttons as matching colored “elements” are presented to them. A text-based instructional placard could provide even further assistance.
