## **Learn about Science Exhibits**

**1. Exhibit Goals**
Our exhibit will help visitors compare different elements on the periodic table. This will be accomplished by demonstrating and allowing visitors to attempt the sorting of different elements on the periodic table (represented by small, colored spheres) into associated matching categories. Users will compare different elements and discover the basic differences between atomic categories of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. Visitor input and the resulting accuracy (or error) in their sorting will be displayed on a small display screen.

**2. Who is your audience?**
The exhibit's intended audience is middle school students. We plan to make the device more accessible by using larger buttons of contrasting colors, and by placing the buttons within easy reach of all users. Middle school students are just beginning to scratch the surface of basic chemistry, and the exhibit will help introduce them to an important related concept. The device can also serve as a reminder of this concept to more experienced users, and serves as an enjoyable color-sorting game for younger students.

### **Justification**
*<ins>1. What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?</ins>*

One cue we plan to use with our device is color coordination and seperation which involve seperating three choices based on colors in order to teach elements within the periodic table as either being metallic, nonmetals, and metalloids. Another cue we plan to use would be the implementation of an autonomous selection system based on colors to help organize the color seperation without any inteference of the device.

*<ins>2. How do you plan on designing your "controls"?</ins>*

We plan on a three way control scheme with three buttons to help us gain different results based on the three categories we chose for this device. The user will hit one of these buttons to choose between the three items of a metal, nonmetal, or metalloid to be delivered from the funnel system based on its color scheme of red, blue, or green.

*<ins>3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?</ins>*

We plan to make a durable, evenly spaced, 3D printed plastic device in order for it to last during the exhibit and place it on a flat wide surface to prevent any tipping or dropping from the exhibit table. We plan for our device to handle autonomously for safety reasons to prevent any human interruption from possible hazards like solenoids and motors while the device is running. For comfort, we intend to use a control system which would be easy to operate with simple input commands to operate our device from a user interface.

*<ins>4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device?</ins>*

We plan for the device to remain autonomous in its operation, but we will need to have instructions for the human-device interface where the user can ask for certain criterias for what they want from the device such as a metal, nonmetal, or metalloid. For out interface, we plan to have to elaborate the operation of the buttons and what they stand for, depending on what the user wants to learn about with the three categories.
